## Tasks

### Task 1
- **File:** `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Description:** Created a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`. Implemented a function named `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2
- **File:** `arrayManipulation.js`
- **Description:** Added a function named `formatArrayStrings` to `arrayManipulation.js`. This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number by capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3
- **File:** `userInfo.js`
- **Description:** Created a file named `userInfo.js`. Implemented a function named `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. Returned an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4
- **File:** `README.md`
- **Description:** Added a README file to the repository. Included my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
